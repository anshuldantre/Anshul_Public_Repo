# Why we use : Helps us being efficient by not repeating code, no rewrite, apply DRY method. Also helps in scaling the application, maintenance is easy
# Idea of oops, everything in programming world is object. We have to treat them as object which have certain behaviour and properties
# Outside world could also on object like Rock, trees, brids, or squirrels
# Tree has properties like Trunk, Leaves, Branches & Roots; Tree also behaviour such as Grows, Sways, produces Fruit, Makes Leaves, Drop Leaves (all things throughout lifecycle)
# We use OOps to write these properties and Beahviours and translate real world concepts in programming
# Properties are called attributes and behaviours are defined as methods or a function that gives functionality to these behaviours
# Bird has properties like Feather, Health, Talons & Beak with properties like Eat, sleep, Fly, Makes Nest, Air bomb cars
# Eventually we can make these objects interact with each other, like bird interacting with Tree

# How do we do this while coding, well in two phases where 
# Phase1: is planning/Setup where we write a lot of code, We define those attributes & methods in blueprints called Classes. They hold information what each object is going to have
# Phase2: is the implementation of a class, its the actual object. 

# Attributes : What is can have (Variables inside a class)
# Methods : What it can do (Methods/functions inside a class)

# Instance / Object are same things (Creating a class doesn't create the instance, we have to use class to implement it)
# Private Methods: These are no longer accessible via the instances. By default everything is set as public
# Defaulting some values as the time of instantiation is called a constructor
# Inhertance is when a class is extended fruther with soemthing from parent and new things from the child 
# Protected: Inherting the private instance in child class but stayign private within instances
